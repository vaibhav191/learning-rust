A path can take two forms:

1. An absolute path is the full path starting from a crate root; for code from an external crate, the absolute path begins with the crate name, and for code from the current crate, it starts with the literal crate.
2. A relative path starts from the current module and uses self, super, or an identifier in the current module.

MAKING STRUCTS AND ENUMS PUBLIC

If we use pub before a struct definition, we make the struct public, but the structâ€™s fields will still be private.

We only need to define pub at enum level to make all enum items public as well.
But in struct, we need to define each and every item that needs to be public, else its implicitly defined as private.
