1. Slice allows referencing a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.

instead of:
fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {

use:
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {

as an immutable slice of a String is the same as a string literal
hence the new declaration would allow us to pass a slice of a String, or a reference to the String.
