panic! macro is used for unrecoverable errors, like accessing an array past the end, or explicitly calling panic! macro.
panic prints failure message, unwinds, cleans up stack and quits.
environment variable allows to print call stack when a panic occurs.
we can switch from unwinding to abort upon a panic by adding panic='abort' to profile sections in cargo.toml
