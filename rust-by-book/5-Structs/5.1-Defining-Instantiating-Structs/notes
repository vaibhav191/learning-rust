1. Struct is like a custom data type, allows packing different elements together.
2. It is like an object's data attribute.
3. Structs can have methods, implemented inside block defined by keyword impl.
4. Tuple structs - struct name provides but doesn't have names associated with their fields, rather they just have the types of the fields.
